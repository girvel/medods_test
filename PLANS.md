- [x] Explore Gin docs more

## The main part

- [x] Set up docker
- [x] Access/refresh POC
- [x] Connect postgres
- [x] Store token
- [x] /guid
- [x] /refresh
- [ ] Split into files
- [ ] Do an integration test
- [ ] Reissue refresh token on /refresh
- [ ] User-Agent limitation
- [ ] Webhook
- [ ] /logout

## Finalization

- [ ] Should it be possible to get an access token while there's a refresh token issued?
- [ ] Logging (gin and built-in, figure out)
- [ ] GIN-debug messages
- [ ] Serve in release mode
- [ ] Resolve TODOs
- [ ] Read more on context module
